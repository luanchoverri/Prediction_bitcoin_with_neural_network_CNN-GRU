# Prediction_bitcoin_with_neural_network_CNN-GRU
 This repository contains a project with a neural network that combines CNN and GRU to predict Bitcoin prices. The hybrid architecture captures spatial and temporal patterns, resulting in accurate predictions. Complete code, datasets, and documentation provided. Ideal for Bitcoin price analysis.



The combination of CNN and GRU offers several advantages in the process of predicting the price of Bitcoin. CNN, being capable of extracting relevant features from historical data, allows capturing spatial patterns in prices. On the other hand, GRU, being a recurrent unit that models long-term dependencies in sequential data, can capture temporal patterns and capture the long-term evolution of Bitcoin prices.
